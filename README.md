What is HeavySpleef?

Spleef is a gamemode in Minecraft where your goal is to knock out players by destroying the floor under them so that they fall down.
If a player touches a losezone or water/lava he is out of the game. Last man standing wins...
HeavySpleef provides an easy to use plugin to setup and maintain Spleef games automagically.
For more infos how to setup an game visit the documentation on Bukkit-Dev.

Made for Bukkit & Spigot (Minecraft 1.8)
